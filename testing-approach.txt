Testing Approach and Considerations

1. Page Object Model (POM) Implementation
   - Created a BasePage class for common functionality
   - Implemented ShoppingCartPage for cart-specific operations
   - Encapsulated selectors and methods for better maintenance
   - Reduced code duplication and improved reusability

2. Test Structure and Organization
   - Grouped tests by functionality (Navigation, Cart Items, Checkout, etc.)
   - Used descriptive test names for better readability
   - Implemented beforeEach hook for test setup
   - Maintained independent test cases

3. Test Coverage Considerations
   - Navigation functionality
     * Verified all navigation links are present and enabled
     * Tested navigation between different pages
     * Ensured proper page loading after navigation

   - Cart Operations
     * Validated item count and details
     * Tested price calculations dynamically
     * Handled out-of-stock items
     * Verified quantity management
     * Checked discount badges

   - Checkout Process
     * Verified checkout button states
     * Tested disabled state with out-of-stock items
     * Validated error messages

   - Responsive Design
     * Tested on multiple viewport sizes
     * Verified layout adaptation
     * Checked element visibility across devices

4. Dynamic Testing Approach
   - Implemented dynamic total calculation
   - Avoided hardcoded values
   - Made tests resilient to data changes
   - Added proper error handling

5. Best Practices Implemented
   - Used async/await for better readability
   - Implemented proper waiting strategies
   - Added clear error messages
   - Maintained test independence
   - Used type safety with TypeScript

6. Maintenance Considerations
   - Centralized selectors for easy updates
   - Created reusable methods
   - Added clear documentation
   - Implemented modular structure

7. Performance Considerations
   - Optimized test execution
   - Reduced unnecessary waits
   - Used efficient selectors
   - Implemented parallel test execution

8. Reliability Considerations
   - Added proper error handling
   - Implemented retry mechanism for CI
   - Added screenshots and videos on failure
   - Included trace collection for debugging

9. Future Considerations
   - Easy to add new test cases
   - Scalable for additional features
   - Maintainable for long-term use
   - Adaptable to changing requirements
